Sure, here's a sample README.md for your repository explaining the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm in JavaScript:

Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm in JavaScript
This repository contains an implementation of the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm in JavaScript. The MST algorithm is used to find the smallest set of edges that connects all vertices in a given graph without any cycles. It's commonly used in various applications such as network design, clustering, and more.
